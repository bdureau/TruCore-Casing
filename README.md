# TruCore-Casing
This is an attempt to make spare parts for my TruCore motors
TruCore rocket motor casing which I used to buy do not seam to be made anymore.
I have measured my casings so that machinist can reproduce them. The design are currently made using OpenScad so that I can 3D print them and make sure that they look like the original ones. I will be converting them to drawing that machinist can read. 
Casing is made of aluminium and nozzle is made of graphite.
I do need help for the parts that I am missing so if you own any of the truCore casing can you please email me the measurements.
